This is our joint Ludum Dare game jam entry, based on the theme 'Connected Worlds'.

###Ludum Dare page link(http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-30/?action=preview&uid=34442)

First time entering Ludum Dare, or making a full game. May have underestimated the amount of time needed to complete, but we made it! 

We created a message-in-a-bottle-god simulator, which involves profiling people and connecting their worlds. 

Find a character who has a message they want to send. 
Now find the most compatible person to send the message to. 
Use your cunning to complete the mini-game, at which point you will find out whether you selected the right recipient. 
Send all the messages to the correct recipients to complete the game. 

Thanks for having a look.
